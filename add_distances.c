I. Add two distances

Write a C Program that uses structures to store two distances in the inch-feet system provided by the user. The program then adds those two distances and displays the resulting distance.
An example of output is shown below:

Enter 1st distance
Enter feet: 23
Enter inches: 8.6

Enter 2nd distance
Enter feet: 34
Enter inches: 2.4

Sum of distances = 57' 11.0"

Note:
1. Must use structures (struct)
2. Accept feet as integer, inch as float. Assume inches will always be under 12 for the input.
3. Display output only as below - with one space between feet and inches, and inches with one decimal place:
    Sum of distances = 57' 11.0"
4. Remember to accomadate for when inches add to be > 12.0
